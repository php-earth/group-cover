## Contributing cover photo

You can propose your vision of the cover photo of course. Before doing that
please check if it corresponds with the following rules:

* Size of the image must fit the requirement for different devices
* Exported format must be PNG
* Graphics should include a link to the group's rules and describe the main context
  of this group i.e. **PHP**
* Keep in mind that Facebook buttons cover parts of the photo
* Different devices show the photo differently depending on the screen resolution
* Understand that each cover photo should be present and visible for longer period
  of time. Changing cover photo in the group every week is maybe too frequently.
* Check and agree to send your contribution that complies with the legal information
  described at the bottom of this file
* Don't sign graphics with your logo or name (your contribition will be noted
  elsewhere for this purpose)
* For inspiration please check [previous cover photos](https://github.com/php-earth/group-cover/releases)
* Be creative :)
